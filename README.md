# mp3_player_assignment

Assignment:


Create a simple Android widget that plays a randomly selected .mp3 file from the device's library. The app should:

* Include a stop and start function

* Display the elapsed time

* Display basic metadata of the audio file

* Have the ability to run in the background, allowing for other sounds to be output while continuing to play the .mp3

* Be created without the use of third-party libraries

Time to implement ~6 hours.
